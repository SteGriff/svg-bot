# SVG Bot

## What I'm doing

This is the source for a [Paprika](https://paprika.me.uk) bot which produces SVGs of things (mostly animals) talking to each other. See `grammar.txt.svg`

## SVGs

The original SVGs should face to the right. They can be flipped by the grammar to face left using a `<g transform>`
